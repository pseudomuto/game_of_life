# Conway's Game of Life
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pseudomuto/game_of_life.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pseudomuto/game_of_life)

I went to a Ruby Hack Night and had some trouble getting this working by
the time I left. So I thought I'd sleep on it and give it a shot.

There were two specific things that helped a lot for me:

* RSpec - without tests, I got stuck in a cycle of fixing/breaking things
* [inject](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Enumerable.html#method-i-inject) - pretty much the coolest Ruby method I've seen yet!

# This project uses:

* [TomDoc](http://tomdoc.org/)
* [RSpec](http://rspec.info/)
* [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard)
* [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/)
