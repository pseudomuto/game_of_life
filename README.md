# Conway's Game of Life

I went to a Ruby Hack Night and had some trouble getting this working by
the time I left. So I thought I'd sleep on it and give it a shot.

There were two specific things that helped a lot for me:

* RSpec - without tests, I got stuck in a cycle of fixing/breaking things
* Inject - pretty much the coolest Ruby method I've seen yet!
